## About the Project
This project consists of the core concepts of Python, which are written on, elaborated upon, and are structured.  Many of the concepts which are layed out in adjunct with many sample programs to further facilitate the understanding of the materials.

The objective of the project is to demonstrate the following:
* practice writing very simple programs that demonstrate an understanding of the materials

## Getting Started
The notes in the next section are organized via classifications of types of programming concepts.  To be able to see the notes, click on the desired directories until you find the concept that you would like to learn more about.  To then be able to read the notes, simply open the link to be directed to the desired README.md file.
