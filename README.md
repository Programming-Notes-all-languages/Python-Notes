## Variables

<ul>
  <li>
    <a>Every <em>variable</em> holds a value, which is the information associated with that variable</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a>Here is an example of a variable declaration and initialization: message = "Hello Python World!</a>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a>If you wanted to print message's contents, you would do the following: print(message)</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a>The output of this code would be: Hello Python World!</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a>You can change the value of a variable in your program at any time, and Python will always keep track of its current value</a>
  </li>
